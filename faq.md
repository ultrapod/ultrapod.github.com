##How can I support Project ULTRApod?
Spread the word, donate, or buy something from our store!

##Why is it called the ULTRApod?
We call it the ULTRApod because it uses ultraviolet light to clean water! Pod denotes an easy to use, self contained system, which also describes our product. Put them together... v√≥ila!

##How big is an ULTRApod?
Many people we've talked to have imagined the ULTRApod to be much smaller than the actual design. Our device is about a meter wide, a meter tall and a meter and a half long. For reference, that's roughly the size of a classic science classroom table.
