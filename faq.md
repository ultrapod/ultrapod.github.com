##How can I support Project ULTRApod?
Spread the word, donate, or buy something from our store!

##Why is it called the ULTRApod?
We call it the ULTRApod because it uses ultraviolet light to clean water! Pod denotes an easy to use, self contained system, which also describes our product. Put them together... v√≥ila!

##How big is an ULTRApod?
Many people we've talked to have imagined the ULTRApod to be much smaller than the actual design. Our device is about a meter wide, a meter tall and a meter and a half long. For reference, that's roughly the size of a classic science classroom table.

##Where would the ULTRApod be useful?
Because we're currently working on a modular design, the ultimate goal would be to implement our device almost anywhere in the world that needs biologically sanitized water. At the moment, however, the device is powered by a hydrokinetic turbine - which means that our goal would be to deploy it in places such as Dhaka, Bangladesh (the Padma River, as featured on the front page, is contaminated).
