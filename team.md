##The Founding Four

Our team was founded by four high school students from Northern Virginia, the original CIRPSICSR team at SOIA.
-The Dear Leader, Daniel Jang.
-Public Relations Maestro and Mad Scientist, Usnish Majumdar
-The Technomage, Sam Girvin
and
-The Business Czar and Carbon Credits Connoisseur, Meredith Burkle.

Some personal details: Daniel never ever sleeps and can't understand why others do, Usnish discourses freely about neurobiology, Sam is a long-distance runner, and Meredith spends her free time swimming with the fishies.

##Further Awesome Additions to the Team

Ananth Sridhar, our latest member, is a talented and innovative technician and builder who'll assist greatly with the creation of prototype one.
