Our design process starts with fluid analysis, either in SolidWorks or Autodesk Inventor. Both of these programs can do complex analysis, Solidworks through its simulation package FloWorks and Inventor through its multiphysics engine. Once we have modeled a part, we set the boundary and initial conditions of a test fluid, and then run a simulation. Once the simulation has finished, we are left with both qualitative and quantitative results that describe the motion of water past our component. Flow analysis allows us to check our original design assumptions and then optimize our geometry in response to the results. Without these sophisticated tools, we would be building the ULTRApod on essentially intuition; fluid dynamics simulation allows us to process water and generate power much more efficiently than we could by prototyping alone. In this video, Ananth is running a simulation of the power generator.
