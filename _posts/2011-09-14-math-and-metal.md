In the Energy Systems Technology Lab at our school, we've been designing in SolidWorks to generate detailed models and basic fluid dynamics visualizations of the first components. Meanwhile, we've also been working with [OpenFOAM](http://www.openfoam.com/), an open source fluid dynamics platform, so that we can confirm and optimize the designs made in SolidWorks. Our first building materials should arrive within a couple of weeks, which will be exciting!

The picture below is the SolidWorks FloXpress flow visualization of our hydrocyclonic separator, which we will be using as a prefilter to remove the bulk of silt and sediment from our water and extend the effective lifetime of our filtering system.
